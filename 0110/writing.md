**Q. Do you think humans will be able to reverse the negative effects of climate change? Please share your thoughts.**

I don't believe humans can do that. Humans are greedy, grabbing anything they want from nature.
Most people think about money rather than sustainability. 
Some Businessmen care about money, harming the environment, and gaining resources from mother nature.
People can't gather together to save the earth.

**Q. Would you rather see animals in a zoo or on a nature documentary? Please discuss.**

I think it is a different experience that sees animals in person.
You can watch them very closely.
In the zoo, you can watch them run and eat in front of you.
Furthermore, you can smell the smells they have. 
You can feel the real lives rather than watch them on the screen.

**Q. Do you think humans will eventually move on to other planets? Why or why not?**
A. 

I don't think so. There have been billions of years since the earth's birth.
But until now, we haven't seen any other planets have lives. 
We can't find any planets there are suitable environments like the earth. 
Besides, we can't move fast in the universe. 
It makes too much effort to do Mars landing with modern technology. So I don't believe it.
