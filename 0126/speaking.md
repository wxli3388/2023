* Do you often go to the libraryï¼Ÿ

I seldom go to the library.
I prefer studying in a leisurely condition.
I feel more comfortable when I study in my room.
Also, some people in the libraries won't obey the rule and sometimes make some noise.
I want to study in a quiet and no people environment.
Furthermore, if I want to rest or go to the washroom, I need to pay more attention to my personal property. It's inconvenient for me if I want to do other things.
